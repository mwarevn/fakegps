/**
 * SpeedSyncManager - Synchronizes control speed and actual simulated speed with Xposed hooks
 *
 * Problem:
 * - User sets speed on slider (e.g., 40 km/h) - this is CONTROL SPEED
 * - RouteSimulator applies curve reduction (e.g., 40 × 0.4 = 16 km/h) - this is ACTUAL SPEED
 * - LocationHook needs ACTUAL speed for GPS
 * - SensorSpoofHook needs CURVE REDUCTION for sensor adjustment
 * - UI needs to show both CONTROL (what user set) and ACTUAL (after curves)
 *
 * Solution: Track both speeds separately using atomic references
